This course provides an overview of methods and tools for applied data analysis. It is geared toward research in biological anthropology and evolutionary biology, but the material covered is applicable to a wide range of natural, social science, and humanities disciplines. Students will receive practical, hands-on training in various data science tools and workflows, including data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical analysis and interpretation, and literate programming and version control.

Statistical topics to be covered include basic descriptive and inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, regression, and linear modeling. Statistical inference will be considered from a frequentist perspective, introducing both parametric and permutation/resampling techniques. If we have time, I will also introduce a Bayesian perspective, although this approach will not be tackled at a particularly advanced level. Additional methods and tools will also be covered based on student interest (e.g., geospatial data analysis, phylogenetic comparative methods, social network analysis, text corpus construction and mining, population genetic analysis) and on how quickly the class feels moving forward.

The course particularly emphasizes the development of data science skills, focusing on the practical side of data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Students will learn to use the statistical programming language ***R*** as well as other useful software tools (e.g., text editors, shell scripts, databases, query languages, and version control systems).

# Course Logistics {.unnumbered}

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

By the end of this course, you should:

-   be familiar with **key concepts and methods** in applied data science for acquiring and managing data, conducting exploratory data analyses, testing statistical hypotheses, building models to classify and make predictions about data, and evaluating model performance;
-   have a facility with **modern tools for data analysis**, (e.g., the ***R*** programming environment, version control systems, the Unix command line, web APIs) and be able to apply "best practices" in data science;
-   know how to **interact with both local and remote data sources** to store, query, process, and analyze data presented a variety of common formats (e.g., delimited text files, structured text files, various database systems);
-   be comfortable **writing simple computer programs/scripts** for data management, statistical analysis, visualization, and more specialized applications;
-   know how to design and implement **reproducible data science workflows** that take a project from data acquisition to analysis to presentation and be able to organize your work using a version control system;
-   and be able to apply all of these tools to **questions of interest in the natural and social sciences**.

## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

At least one semester of introductory statistics is recommended. Prior programming experience is not expected, but would be helpful!

title: "Programming Style Guide"
---

# Programming Style Guide {.unnumbered}

As much as possible, your scripts, programs, and functions should be written in a **consistent** programming style, which makes them easier to read, write, and understand. Some programmers are very opinionated as to what stylistic conventions to follow, and as you become more familiar with ***R*** and more practiced with writing code, you will likely settle on a set that you find particular sensible. I try (not always successfully!) to follow recommendations below, which are largely consistent with those in the much-more-complete [{tidyverse} Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

## File Type Conventions {.unnumbered}

-   Use the uppercase ".R" extension for files containing ***R*** code
-   Use the ".RData" extension for files that contain binary data
-   Use the ".Rmd" extension for ***RMarkdown*** documents
-   Use lowercase file extensions for other standard filetypes (e.g., ".csv", ".jpg", ".docx", ".xlsx")

## Stylistic Conventions {.unnumbered}

-   Use a space before and after the standard backwards assignment operator `<-` and other infix operators (except for `=` used in function arguments), but not around parentheses or brackets:

    -   `x <- "Hello"`

-   Even though the syntax is valid, avoid using `=` for assignment, except when assigning values to named arguments in a function:

    -   `rnorm(n=1000, mean=50, sd=10)`

-   Even though the syntax is valid, do not abbreviate `TRUE` and `FALSE` to `T` and `F`

-   Generally avoid using the forward assignment operator `->` except at the end of a sequence of piped operations:

    -   `df <- df %>% filter(age > 50) %>% select(name, age, sex, body_weight)`
    -   `df %>% filter(age > 50) %>% select(name, age, sex, body_weight) -> df`

-   Use a space after a comma when listing the arguments of a function:

    -   `x <- c(4, 5, 6, 7)`
    -   `paste("Data science", "is", "cool", sep=" ")`

## Programming Conventions {.unnumbered}

-   Use simple, single characters for temporary variables, like indices:

    -   `x <- 1:10`
    -   `for (i in 1:100){print(i)}`

-   Whenever possible, use short, descriptive names for variables:

    -   `rate <- 5.6`
    -   `sex <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M" "F", "M")`

-   For longer, multi-word variable, function, or argument names, use either *camelCase* or *snake_case*:

    -   `interestRate <- 0.45`
    -   `say_hi <- function(x){print(paste0("Hello, ",x))}`
    -   `print_n_rows <- function(x, n_rows=10){print(x[n_rows,])}`

-   Include *default* values in your function definitions:

    -   `n_rows=10` in the preceding example

-   Include error checking in your functions

-   For support files that contain a single function, name the file to match the name of the function defined in the file:

    -   "prettyPrint.R" for a file that contains the function `prettyPrint()`
    -   "rescale_image.R" for a file that contains the function `rescale_image()`

## Code Formatting Conventions {.unnumbered}

-   Try to keep lines of code to less than 80 characters

-   Use comments liberally to make notes about what you code does

    -   ***R*** ignores lines starting with the hashtag character (`#`) as well as text after this character (until it encounters a line break)

        ```{r}
        # assign `g`, the constant for gravitational acceleration
        g <- 9.80665 # units are m/s^2
        ```

    -   Use a single `#` to introduce a comment, and separate comments from code with a single empty line before the comment:

        ```{r}
        x <- 3
            
        # Now add 2 to x...
        x <- x + 2
        ```

    -   In ***RStudio***, use four dashes `----` at the end of a comment line to indicate a section... this should allow for code folding in your scripts:

        ```{r}
        # Section 1 ----
        x <- 5
        y <- 3
        z <- x + y^2
        ```

> **NOTE:** In ***RStudio***, you can highlight several lines and then use `âŒ˜-SHIFT-C` to comment/uncomment multiple lines simultaneously.

-   Use indentation to identify (nested) blocks of code

    -   Use spaces rather than the invisible tab (`\t`) character for indentation
    -   Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces, 4 spaces) to keep your code looking neat

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/indentation.png")
```

-   Use a *linter* (see under the "Addins" section of the ***RStudio*** toolbar) to catch common style "errors"

> **NOTE:** In ***RStudio***, you can use `âŒ˜-SHIFT-A` within in an ***R*** code block to try to neatly and consistently reformat your code. Also, when working in the text editor in ***RStudio***, holding the option (`âŒ¥`) key while selecting with the cursor allows you to highlight/edit replace text in multiple rows simultaneously.

## Version Control System {.unnumbered}

```{r include=FALSE}
library(emo)
```

-   Finally, always, always, always use a *version control system*!!! `r emo::ji("smiley")` See [**Module 5**](#module-05) and [**Module 6**](#module-06) for more details.

```{r include=FALSE}
detach(package:emo)
```

# (PART\*) Part I - Using ***R*** and ***RStudio*** {.unnumbered}

# Getting Started with ***R*** {#module-01}

## Objectives

> The goal of this module is to get everyone's computers set up with ***R*** for the semester and to provide background and an introduction to the ***R*** programming language and environment.

## Backstory

The name ***R*** is a nod to the statistical programming language ***S*** (for "Statistics") that inspired its creation. ***S*** was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and later sold to a small company that further developed it into ***S-Plus***. ***R*** was then developed as an alternative to ***S*** by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the Department of Statistics at the University of Aukland, New Zealand.

***R*** is an high-level, interpreted language, like ***Python*** or ***Ruby***, where commands are executed directly and sequentially, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. Each statement is translated, on the fly, into a sequence of subroutines that have already been compiled into machine code.

***R*** is open-source software, meaning that the source code for the program is freely available for anyone to modify, extend, and improve upon. ***R*** is also FREE (!) for anyone to use and distribution. The large and active community of users and developers is one of the reasons that ***R*** has become very popular in academics, science, engineering, and business - any field that requires data analytics. Developers have also built in the capacity for easily making production-quality graphics, making it a great tool for data visualization. There are thus **many** good reasons to learn and use ***R***.

Here are a few of the main ones, in a nutshell:

-   ***R*** is high quality software. It is actively developed by an international community of statisticians and software developers with multiple releases and bug fixes every year.
-   ***R*** is FREE (as in thought). The source code is openly avaialable under the GNU General Public License, which allows others to easily evaluate the quality of the code, contribute new functionality, and quickly fix bugs.
-   ***R*** is FREE (as in beer). Whereas licenses for other statistical software such as ***SAS***, ***SPSS***, or ***Stata*** may cost thousands of dollars, ***R*** is available free of charge.
-   ***R*** is available for multiple platforms. Installers are available for Windows, MacOS, and other Unix based systems and most package are OS agnostic.
-   ***R*** is extremely extensible. If there is a procedure you want to run that is not included in one of the standard packages, it is likely available in one of the thousands of extensions packages that have been developed and are also freely available. You can also use ***R*** to control or interface with external applications, including other programming languages (like ***Python***, ***SQL***, ***C++***, ***NetLogo***), other analysis tools (like GIS software), and databases (like ***MySQL***, ***PostgreSQL***, ***SQLite***, etc). It is also always possible for you to improve ***R*** yourself. You can **literally** do just about anything in ***R***.
-   ***R*** has a vibrant, intelligent, and generous user community. LOTS of resources are available online for learning and troubleshooting (see, for example, the section on ***R*** at the [**Stack Overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info) website.

***R*** can be run in several ways:

-   Interactively from a console prompt after launching the program from the command line in either a terminal window or command shell.
-   In batch mode, by sourcing commands from an ***R*** script file (which is a simple text file).
-   From within an ***R*** graphical user interface (or GUI) or integrated development envrionment (or IDE), which accommodates both of the above.

We are going to introduce several of these ways of working with ***R***, but the easiest and most convenient is to use an IDE.

## Installing the ***R*** Software

-   Download and install ***R*** from the [**Compehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)**](https://cran.r-project.org/) website. Choose the correct version for your operating system.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/install-R.png")
```

-   If you are using MacOS, you should consider also installing [***XQuartz***](https://www.xquartz.org/), which lets you use the ***X11*** X Windows management software.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/install-XQuartz.png")
```

-   Open the ***R*** program from wherever you installed it (e.g., in MacOS, double-click on the ***R.app*** application in your Applications folder; on a PC, search for and open the ***Rgui.exe*** application, which should be located somewhere inside your `C:\Program Files\R\R-[version]` folder... you should see the console window and the `>` prompt. Note that your screen may look slightly different from the screenshots below.

Also, note that you can also run ***R*** in a terminal shell (MacOS or Unix) or from the Windows command shell after starting it with the command `r`. Depending on whether you have set your PATH variable to detect the ***R*** executable file, you may or may not need to first navigate into the directory containing the executable file.

-   On MacOS, the default GUI will look as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/R-console-Mac.png")
```

-   On Windows, the default GUI (***RGui***) looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RGui-windows.png")
```

## Exploring the ***R*** Console

-   ***R*** can be used as an interactive calculator from the console prompt, either in a GUI or in the shell.

    -   Standard mathematical order of operations applies (PEMDAS - parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).

-   The assignment operator `<-` can be used to assign a value, the results of an operation, or specific code to an *object* (e.g., a variable, a function, a complex data structure).

    -   You can also use `=`, but I prefer to use that **only** to assign values to function *arguments* (more on this later).

-   You can set various *settings* to customize your interactions with ***R***.

    -   To change the standard *prompt*, use the function `options()` with the `prompt` argument: `options(prompt="<prompt text>")`, where you supply, between the quotes, text with what you want the prompt to say.

    -   To list the current *working directory* (the default folder where dialog boxes will open and where files and output will be stored unless otherwise specified), use the function `getwd()`, which has no arguments.

    -   To set the current *working directory*, use the function `setwd("<path>")`, where you supply, between the quotes, the path to the desired directory.

        -   On MacOS, these directory options are also available under the **Misc** menu.
        -   On Windows, you can set the *working directory* with the **Change dir** command under the **File** menu.
        -   In ***RStudio***, the *working directory* can be set under the **Session** menu.

-   Within the active workspace, ***R*** keeps a log of all executed commands, and you can use the *arrow keys* to scroll through this history. In ***RStudio***, this list is accessible in the **History** tab.

-   Commands and code can also be written in a text file or *script* and sent to the console for execution.

    -   In most GUIs/IDEs, you can choose to create a new *script* document from the **File** menu, which opens in a text editor of some kind.
    -   From within the text editor, you can send an individual command to the ***R*** interpreter by positioning your cursor somewhere in the line you want to execute and hitting `âŒ˜-RETURN` (Mac) or either `control-R` (for the default GUI that ships with ***R***) or `control-ENTER` (for the ***RStudio*** GUI) (PC).
    -   To send a set of commands to the console as a *batch*, you can highlight the code lines of code you want to execute and then use these same commands.
    -   You can include comments in your scripts by prefacing them with `#`.
    -   Script files can be saved just like any other type of text file, usually with the ".R" extension by default.

-   To view the names of all of the objects in your current *workspace*, you can use the `ls()` function. In ***RStudio***, these also all appear in the **Environment** tab.

-   To clear objects from your workspace, use the `rm()` function, where an individual object's name or a list of object names can be included as the argument to `rm()`.

-   To remove all objects from your workspace, you can use `rm(list=ls())`.

    -   In this case, you are passing to `rm()` a list consisting of all the objects in the workspace, provided by the `ls()` function.

### CHALLENGE: {.unnumbered}

Fire up ***R*** in your mode of choice (by typing "R" at the console prompt in the **Terminal** in MacOS or from a **cmd** or other shell prompt in Windows) and then practice interacting with the software via the command line and console window.

-   Try doing some math in ***R*** by using it to evaluate the following expressions:

    -   8 + 5
    -   10 - 6 / 2
    -   (10 - 6) / 2
    -   10 \* 5
    -   15 / 5
    -   10 \^ 5
    -   3 \* *pi* (where *pi* is a built-in constant)

```{r}
8 + 5
10 - 6 / 2
(10 - 6) / 2
10 * 5
15 / 5
10 ^ 5
3 * pi
```

-   Try working with assignments:

    -   Assign the number 6 to a variable called **x**.
    -   Assign the number 5 to a variable called **y**.
    -   Assign x \* y to a variable called **z**.
    -   Assign x\^2 to a variable called **x2**.

```{r}
x <- 6
x
y <- 5
y
z <- x * y
z
x2 <- x ^ 2
x2
```

-   Try out some of the built-in functions in ***R***:

    -   Assign the number 10 to a variable called **x**.
    -   Take the natural log of **x** using the `log()` function.
    -   Find the factorial of **x** using the `factorial()` function.
    -   Assign the number 81 to a variable called **y**.
    -   Take the square root of y using the `sqrt()` function.
    -   Assign the number -8.349218 to a variable called **z**.
    -   Use `?round` or `help(round)` to view the help file for the function `round()`.
    -   Round **z** to the 1000ths place.
    -   Use `?abs()` to view the help file for the function `abs()`.
    -   Take the absolute value of **z** \* **y**.

```{r}
x <- 10
log(x)
factorial(x)
y <- 81
sqrt(y)
z <- -8.349218
round(z, digits = 3)
abs(z * y)
```

-   Use the `ls()` function to list the variables currently stored in your active session.

    -   How many do you have?

```{r}
ls()
```

-   Use the command `rm(list=ls())` to clear all the variables you have defined.
-   What happens if you type a function name without including the parentheses?
-   What happens if you type a function with an invalid or missing argument?

<hr>

# Getting Started with ***RStudio*** {#module-02}

## Objectives

> The goal of this module is to familiar yourself with the ***RStudio*** Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Installing the ***RStudio*** Software

Apart from the GUIs included in the MacOS and Windows installations of ***R***, there are several IDEs that connect to the ***R*** interpreter and provide lots of convenient functionality. One of the most versatile and easy to use (and my favorite) is ***RStudio***.

-   Download and install the [***RStudio***](https://www.rstudio.com/) Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/install-RStudio.png")
```

-   Open the ***RStudio*** program

The workspace that you see is divided into four separate panes (**Source** and **Console** panes on the left, two customizable panes on the right). You can modify the layout and appearance of the ***RStudio*** IDE to suit your taste by selecting **Preferences** from the **RStudio** menu (MacOS) or by selecting **Global Options** from the **Tools** menu (both MacOS and Windows).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RStudio.png")
```

The **Source** pane is where you work with and edit various file types (e.g., scripts), while the **Console** pane is where you run commands in the ***R*** interpreter and see the results of those commands. The other two customizable panes provide easy access to useful tools and overviews of your interactions with ***R***. For example, the **Environment** tab can be used to view all of the objects in the different environments in your current workspace, the **History** tab shows the log of all of the commands you have sent to the interpreter, and the **Packages** tab provides a convenient interface for installing and loading packages (see below).

Within ***RStudio***, you can change the working directory by going to the **Session** menu and selecting **Set Working Directory**.

### CHALLENGE: {.unnumbered}

Repeat the basic maths CHALLENGE from [**Module 01**](#module-01) using the editor and console in ***RStudio***.

> **NOTE:** In both the base GUI that ships with the ***R*** application and in ***RStudio***, the console supports *code completion*. Pressing `TAB` after starting to type a function or variable name will give you suggestions as to how to complete what you have begun to type. In ***RStudio***, this functionality is present also when you are typing code in the text editor in the **Source** pane. Also helpful in ***RStudio*** are popup windows that accompany code completion that show, for each function, what possible arguments that function can take and their default values.

## Using the ***RStudio*** **Cloud** Server

An alternative (though likely slower!) way to use ***R*** and ***RStudio*** is to run them through a browser from **RStudio's** cloud computing server. To use this approach, visit the [***RStudio Cloud*** website](https://rstudio.cloud/), click the `Get Started` button, and create or sign up for an account.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud.png")
```

You can use a ***Facebook*** or ***GitHub*** account to sign up (I recommend the latter. See [**Module 05**](#module-05) for more info on signing up for and using ***GitHub***) or create a new account that is specifically for ***RStudio Cloud***.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud-signin.png")
```

Once you are signed up, or if you have already done so, you can use your account to log in. Doing so will bring you to the landing page for your ***RStudio Cloud*** account.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud-landing.png")
```

Your account lets you access a sandboxed environment on **RStudio's** servers that contains ***R***, ***RStudio***, any packages you install, your own files, etc., which you are connecting via a web browser. You can effectively use it for development without storing anything on your local machine.

There, if you create a `New Project`, you will set up a new ***R*** project within your account space. Your account space can include multiple projects, each with its own set of associated files.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud-new-project.png")
```

## Customizing the ***RStudio*** IDE

If you open either the *Preferences* (MacOS) or *Global Options* (MacOS or PC) dialog box in ***RStudio*** you can customize the setup and functionality of your IDE.

In the *General* section, I recommend the settings shown below, particularly about restoring your last workspace into memory upon startup and about asking if you wish to save the contents of your current workspace upon shutdown.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/preferences-general.png")
```

Feel free to organize the rest of your setup as you would like. For example, you can change lots of options in the *Code*, *Console*, *Appearance*, and *Pane Layout* sections to set up the IDE as best suits your personal tastes.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/preferences-other.png")
```

Finally, if you have already installed ***git*** on your computer, go to the *Git/SVN* section and make sure that the checkbox "Enable version control interface for RStudio projects" is selected and that the path to your ***git*** executable is filled. If you have installed ***git*** successfully, this should be filled with something like "/usr/bin/git". If it is not, do not worry... we can set this later after installing and troubleshooting that program.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-svn.png")
```

# (PART\*) Exercises {.unnumbered}

# Send Emails Programmatically {.unnumbered}

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

-   Installing and loading/attaching packages
-   Introducing functions and arguments
-   Introducing the {tidyverse} and the pipe `%>%` operator

> **NOTE:** For both of the approaches below, before using Google's gmail server to send emails, there seems to be a key Gmail account setting that has to be changed from the default value: you have to allow "Less Secure Apps" to use your the Gmail account. Details on this setting and on how to make this change can be found as [this link](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)

## Version 1: Using the {emayaili} package {.unnumbered}

The {emayili} package makes sending simple text emails very easy.

#### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Install the {emayili} and {tidyverse} packages.

We can do this at the console prompt...

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("emayili")
install.packages("tidyverse")

# or to do them together...

install.packages(c("emayili", "tidyverse"))
```

We can also do this by using the package manager in ***RStudio***.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/install-packages.png")
```

#### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Load and attach these packages to the search path so you can call functions they contain.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(emayili)
library(tidyverse)
# Note that we can also use `require()` in lieu of `library()`
```

We can also use the {easypackages} packages to do both of these things... {easypackage} makes installing and loading multiple packages "easy" by introducing the `packages()` and `libaries()` functions.

- First, install and load {easypackages}:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("easypackages")
library(easypackages)
```

- Then...
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
packages("emayili", "tidyverse")
libraries("emayili", "tidyverse")

# or even...

my_packages <- c("emayili", "tidyverse")
packages(my_packages)
libraries(my_packages)
```

#### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- Create a new email "message" with the `envelope()` function.

This function takes several intuitive arguments that we can assign values to directly within the function.

```{r}
message <- envelope(
  from = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
  to = c("anthony.difiore@gmail.com", "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu"),
  subject = "Sending a message using {emayili}...",
  text = "Hello! This is a plain text message.")
```

> **NOTE:** ***R*** essentially ignores whitespace (spaces and tab characters) and also allows you to run code from one line to the next. It is even pretty forgiving about where you put carriage returns, although it is good form to place them following a "," or before/after a parenthesis or brace.

Using {tidyverse} syntax, we can set up the same email as follows:

```{r}
message <- envelope() %>%
  from("anthony.difiore@gmail.com") %>%
  to(c("anthony.difiore@gmail.com", "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu")) %>%
  subject("Sending a message using {emayili}...") %>%
  text("Hello! This is a plain text message.")
```

The difference here is that we are first creating an empty "message" object and then "piping" that object using `%>%` into different helper functions to create the details of the message.

#### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Create an SMTP (or "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol") "server" object with details about how to send a message

```{r}
smtp <- server(
  host = "smtp.gmail.com",
  port = 465,
  username = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
  password = "") # add your password between quotation marks here
```

#### Step 5 {.unnumbered}

- Send your message by passing it as an argument to the server object. Then, CHECK YOUR EMAIL to confirm that you receive the message.

```{r eval = FALSE}
smtp(message, verbose = TRUE)

# NOTE: setting verbose = FALSE (or omitting the argument) will suppress output to the console
```

#### Next Steps? {.unnumbered}

Use the ***RStudio*** **Help** tab to browse the documentation associated with the {emayali} package to see how you can customize your message, e.g., by adding `cc` or `bcc` arguments, by using a different "reply to" address, by adding attachments, or by encrypting your message.

## Version 2: Using the {blastula} package {.unnumbered}

The {blastula} package allows us to create and send more complex HTML and markdown-based formatted emails.

Similar to {emayili}, {blastula} provides two main functions: [1] `compose_email()` for constructing various parts of a message and [2] `smtp_send()` for specifying email server settings and passing the message to the server to send. However, {blastula} but also adds in some helper functions that allow you to store credentialing information in either a separate text file that is referenced when you run the function to send a message or in your computer's keychain. {blastula} also stores some default information on commonly-used email providers and services (e.g., on Google's "gmail" and Microsoft's "office365" and "outlook"), which may make configuring the server setup easier than using {emayili}.

#### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Install the {blastula} package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("blastula")
```

#### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Load the {blastula} package.

```{r}
library(blastula)
```

#### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- Create a new email "message" with the `compose_email()` function.

This function takes several intuitive arguments that we can assign values to directly within the function.

```{r}
# Compose the message
message <- compose_email(
  body = "Hello! This is a simple HTML message."
  )

# Preview the message
# This will open the HTML message in a browser window or in the RStudio Viewer tab
message
```

We can add some formatting to our email by using the `md()` function and markdown syntax. Here, we pipe `%>%` the `body` argument to the `md()` function to convert it to markdown.

```{r}
# Compose the message
message <- compose_email(
  body = "# Hello!\nThis is a simple **HTML** message with some *markdown* syntax." %>% md()
)

# Preview the message
message
```

We can also spice up our email with an image from a local file

```{r}
# Create text as html
text <- "# Hello!\nThis is a simple **HTML** message with some *markdown* syntax... and a cool picture!"

# Create image as html
image <- add_image(
  file = "/Users/ad26693/Development/Repos/ada-2022/img/batnet.jpg",
  width = 300, align = "center"
)

# Compose the message
message <- compose_email(
  body = c(text, image) %>% md()
)

# Preview the message
message
```

#### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Create a credentials file.

The following will create a `JSON` text file in your working directory that contains default information for your outgoing mail server, e.g., Google's "gmail" server (`host = "smtp.gmail.com"`, `port = 465`) or Microsoft's Office365 server (`host = "smtp.office365.com"`, `port = 587`), along with your email address and your password. When you run the following lines of code, you will be asked to enter a password, which will be stored in the credentials file:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# gmail credentials file
create_smtp_creds_file(
  file = "my_gmail_creds",
  user = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
  provider = "gmail"
)
# show the credentials file
creds_file("my_gmail_creds")

# office365 credentials file
create_smtp_creds_file(
  file = "my_office365_creds",
  user = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
  provider = "office365"
)
# show the credentials file
creds_file("my_office365_creds")
```

> **NOTE**: If you omit the `provider=` argument, you should pass `host=`, `port=`, and `use_ssl=` arguments to the `create_smtp_creds_file()` function.

#### Step 5 {.unnumbered}

- Send the message via STMP using a credentials file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
smtp_send(email = message,
  from = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
  to = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
  subject = "Sending a message using {blastula} and a credentials file...",
  credentials = creds_file(file = "my_gmail_creds"),
  verbose = TRUE
  # NOTE: As above, setting verbose = FALSE (or omitting the argument) will suppress output to the console
)

# or, using the %>% operator and a different server and credentials file...

message %>% smtp_send(
    from = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
    to = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
    subject = "Sending a message using {blastula} and a credentials file...",
    credentials = creds_file(file = "my_office365_creds")
)
```

#### Step 6 {.unnumbered}

- We can also send the message by specifying our credentials manually within the `smtp_send()` function.

The following will prompt us for our password to send the message:

```{r eval = FALSE}
message %>% smtp_send(
    from = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
    to = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
    subject = "Sending a message using {blastula} and entering credentials manually...",
    credentials = creds(
      user = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
      provider = "gmail"
    )
  )

message %>% smtp_send(
    from = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
    to = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
    subject = "Sending a message using {blastula} and entering credentials manually...",
    credentials = creds(
      user = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
      provider = "office365"
    )
  )
```

#### Optional Next Steps? {.unnumbered}

Again, use the ***RStudio*** **Help** tab to browse the documentation associated with the {blastula} package to see how you can customize your message, e.g., with attachments.

#### Even More Next Steps? {.unnumbered}

Finally, it is a bit more complicated, but note that we can also use the {keyring} package along with {blastula} to set up a credentials "key" in our computer's keychain and refer to that to specify our credentials for sending a message. When you create the keys, you will be asked to provide your password.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("keyring")
```

```{r}
library(keyring)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create gmail key
create_smtp_creds_key(
  id = "my_gmail_key", # an identifier for the key
  user = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
  provider = "gmail",
  overwrite = TRUE # this argument is only needed if you have an existing key
)
creds_key("my_gmail_key") # show the key info

# Create office365 key
create_smtp_creds_key(
  id = "my_office365_key", # an identifier for the key
  user = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
  provider = "office365",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
creds_key("my_office365_key") # show the key info
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# View all keys
view_credential_keys()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Send a message with a credentials key
message %>%
  smtp_send(
    from = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
    to = "anthony.difiore@gmail.com",
    subject = "Sending a message using {blastula} and a credentials key...",
    credentials = creds_key(id = "my_gmail_key")
  )

message %>%
  smtp_send(
    from = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
    to = "anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu",
    subject = "Sending a message using {blastula} and a credentials key...",
    credentials = creds_key(id = "my_office365_key"), verbose = TRUE
  )
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Delete all keys
delete_all_credential_keys()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
detach(package:emayili)
detach(package:tidyverse)
detach(package:blastula)
detach(package:keyring)
```
